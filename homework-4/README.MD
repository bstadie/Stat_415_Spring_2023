# Homework 4: Explainability
In this homework, we will consider several methods for explaining the outputs of predictive models. We will focus on attribution methods, which try to weight the relitive importance of inputs with respect to making a prediction. It is important to note there are many methods for considering the interactions between variables. This assignment will not consider those methods, because they get quite complicated quickly. Instead, we will focus on attribution methods such as LIME, PDP, and Integrated Gradients. 




## Dataset

We will use two datasets for this assignment. 


## Analysis Instructions

### Vectorized Data

Starting with the census-tracts-dataset.csv. 
The target variables is percentage of drunk driving accidents. Be sure to set aside a validation set.
